				<h1>Wild Yonder (WIP)</h1>
				<p>This one is the big kahuna.</p>
				<p>Cheekily nicknamed "Connor MMO" by myself and my friends until recently, this game is a sort-of sandbox I've been working on for some time as an excuse to experiment with game development topics that I was interested in exploring...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>online multiplayer synchronization</li>
					<li>interesting mobility options</li>
					<li>managing precise movement over sloped terrain</li>
					<li>crafting and inventory management</li>
					<li>first-person melee combat</li>
					<li>etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can download the latest client and log onto the dedicated server to try it out at <a href="http://wildyonder.net">wildyonder.net</a>.</p>

				<h1>Lady Luck (2023 GMTK Game Jam)</h1>
				<p>This game, created as a submission to the 2023 GMTK Game Jam, was a collaboration with the very talented Blake Hall, a good college buddy of mine. He made most of the art for the game, I handled the coding, and we both worked together on the gameplay and design. Out of <b>6,751</b> entries, it scored <b>#58</b> overall, and we even made it into the jam's official "Best Games" YouTube video <a href="https://youtu.be/tYxZ_LOlFnU?si=vn5YsmnIK0iIKLNt&t=695">for all of 4 glorious seconds</a>.</p>
				<p>The theme of the jam was "Roles Reversed". Blake and I are both big fans of card games in general, especially deck builders like Slay the Spire, and so we created a game where you get to play as "Lady Luck" -- aka Fortuna, the goddess of luck in Greek mythology. Fortuna is responsible for determining the outcome of any coin toss, dice roll, or, in this case, shuffling of a deck of cards. Your job is to rig the decks of both your hapless champion character and his formidable enemies, in such a way that your champion always has the right card at the right time, and that his enemies don't.</p>
				<p>You can download it at the game's <a href="https://cshipway.itch.io/lady-luck">itch.io page</a>.</p>

				<h1>Paper Town VR</h1>
				<p>Interactive art installation, created as a group project during my undergrad studies. A user utilizes a VR headset to see a miniature papercraft village through a live camera. As the user turns in space, a mechanism rotates the camera in real time so as to accommodate the new viewing angle.</p>
				<p>I was responsible for programming the physical mechanism which rotates the camera, as well as the VR-enabled Unity scene, and essentially getting the two to communicate nicely with each other.</p>
				<p>This installation ended up getting some traction in the tech/art community, and was featured at the ACM Siggraph conference in Los Angeles, California.</p>

				<p>A fantasy-themed board game in development for three to five players. Battle monsters, obtain gold, and bid for Relics of increasingly ridiculous power in your quest to slay the dragon before your opponents can. Only one will claim the Grand Bounty!</p>
				<p>A personal project I've been working on here and there for a couple of years now. The gameplay has gone through a couple of major overhauls, but by the time it's done, I hope to have designed a deep and hugely replayable game.</p>
